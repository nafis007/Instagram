It was a similar version of the popular Instagram Application for IOS. It was done as part of the Mobile Computing Course during the pursuit of my Master's Degree
It was a group project, and due to the avaialability of only one MAC machine,
the team members took turns to develop multiple modules of the application. I developed the user registration and login module, Image uploading and
sharing module, and managing backend coding for comment and user search handling.
